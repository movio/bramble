# Bramble

Bramble is a production-ready GraphQL federation gateway.
It is built to be a simple, reliable and scalable way to aggregate GraphQL services together.

### Building and testing

Prerequisite: Go 1.16 or newer

```

To run the tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Comparison with other projects

- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/)

  While Apollo Server is a popular tool we felt is was not the right tool for us as:

  - the federation specification is more complex than necessary
  - it is written in NodeJS where we favour Go

- [Nautilus](https://github.com/nautilus/gateway)

  Nautilus provided a lot of inspiration for Bramble.

  Although the approach to federation was initially similar, Bramble now uses
  a different approach and supports for a few more things:
  fine-grained permissions, namespaces, easy plugin configuration,
  configuration hot-reloading...

  Bramble is also a central piece of software for [Movio](https://movio.co)
  products and thus is actively maintained and developed.
